>   Plot results of an experiment containing several runs of VictimSim2.  For each run, the VictimSim2 saves the number of found and saved victims.  From this, the program plots histograms of saved/rescued victims per severity  (absolute values and relative to the total number of victims), and the Veg and Vsg metrics.
