# EXAMPLE 01: VictimSim
This example allows the user to control the explorer agent with commands given by the keyboard. Upon reaching the time limit, the explorer agent calls the rescuer, which in turn executes a plan stored in memory.

How to use:
- copy the explorer.py, rescuer.py, and main.py to some <folder>
- copy the folder vs to the <folder>

<folder>
   +---- main.py
   +---- rescuer.py
   +---- explorer.py
   +-----vs
         +--- all the VictimSim .py
