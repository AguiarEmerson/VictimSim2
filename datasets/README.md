This folder contains the configuration files and vital signal datasets for different scenarios and purposes.

The name of the folder represents:  
- the size of the grid: columns x rows 
- the number of victims

For instance, a folder named
* _data_20x30_400vic_ would contain a enviroment of size 20 cols x 30 rows with 400 victims.
* _data_800vic_ would contain only the vital signals of the victims for regression/classification tasks. In this case, we omit the width x height information.
